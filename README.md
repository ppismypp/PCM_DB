Database for PCM Heat Transfer Enhancement
==========================================
How to Submit Experimental Data
-------------------------------
This database is created publicly for storing and shareing data for the PCM heat ransfer enhancement research. Please upload the numerical data and experimental data into their related folders. This database can also be used for sharing and reviewing the other's code. You should create a sub-folder under the Numerical folder by doing that.

File Format
-----------
Experimental data should be stored in simple ASCII comma-delimited files (csv files) or excel files (xls or xlsx files); numerical date should be stored in  text files (txt files) or Matlab datafiles (mat files). 

File Naming
-----------
For experimental data, please name your file by the format: experiment number + model name + your name + date (eg. 1_1D heat transfer model_Kai_20200410.csv). For numerical data please use the format: model name + problem name + method + boundary condition + your name (eg. 2D melting_convective heat transfer_implicit_oneside heat flux_Kai.mat).

File Organization
-----------------
After uploading your data, please add a description of you data in the Info file. You should start the description with your file name, and describe your file in the next line. The description should include at least experimental conditions, parameter values, assumptions, methods.
