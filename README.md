Database for PCM Heat Transfer Enhancement
==========================================
How to Submit Experimental Data
-------------------------------
This database is created publicly for storing and shareing data for the PCM heat ransfer enhancement research. Please upload the numerical data and experimental data into their related folders. 

File Format
-----------
Experimental and Model results should be organized in simple ASCII comma-delimited files (*.csv files) with clear header names. Note: For all submitted measurement data, please ensure that results are obtained with a data acquisition rate between 0.2 and 10 Hz. Examples of how to format data submissions, which may be used as templates, are included [here] (https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/tree/master/Non-charring/PMMA).

File Naming
For simplicity, please collect your files in a single folder with your INSTITUTE name [INSTITUTE]. Please save measurement results with a name indicating your INSTITUTE and the experimental apparatus used, for example: INSITUTE_TGA.csv or Institute_ConeCalorimeter_25kW.csv. Gram-scale experiments (e.g., Cone, FPA, gasification) should include this external heat flux information in the file name, as indicated above; mg-scale experiments (e.g., TGA, DSC, MCC) do not need to include heating rate in the filename as this information will be evident from reported data.

File Organization
Measurement data from repeated experiments should be saved and submitted as separate files, numbered sequentially (e.g.,INSITUTE_TGA1.csv and INSITUTE_TGA2.csv).

File Description
Please also include a separate README file (.txt or .docx) that provides a description of the test conditions of all experiments conducted and submitted (see the Measurements section of Guidelines for Participation_MaCFP2020.pdf, for details on what information should be included in this file).

Note, some iteration on formatting may be required before the results can be merged into the MaCFP database.
